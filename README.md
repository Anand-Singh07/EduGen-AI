# EduGen-AI
EduGen AI is an interactive, AI-powered course builder that generates C++ lessons, YouTube video links, and quizzes from a single topic. Built by Anand Singh (Lovely Professional University) to showcase AI-driven learning automation.

About the Project

EduGen AI (short for Education Generator AI) is an AI-powered course builder that automatically creates interactive learning modules from a single prompt.
It was designed as a college project by Anand Singh (Lovely Professional University) to demonstrate how artificial intelligence can generate structured educational content such as lessons, video tutorials, and quizzes.

With a single topic (e.g., Pointers in C++), EduGen AI builds a mini-course including:

Lesson breakdowns and learning objectives

Embedded or linked YouTube videos for visual learning

Automatically generated explanations and quizzes

Instant scoring with feedback

Responsive, mixed dark/light themed design
